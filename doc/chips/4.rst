Chpldoc Class and Record Inheritance
====================================

Status

Abstract
--------

Define a documentation style for the inherited fields and methods on a
particular class or record, in addition to those already defined on the type.


Rationale
---------

When one looks a summary of a class or record, one would expect to find every
method of note that can be called on that type and every field that is visible.
This must obviously include methods and fields that were defined by ancestors of
the type.  We view a class/record summary view to be a useful mode for our
documentation to take, so this portion of the summary must be considered.  This
proposal attempts to determine what format that summary would take when
including this additional information.

Decisions
---------

After discussion via email on May 18th through 20th, 2015, it was decided that
this feature, while useful, was not considered high enough priority to be
worked on during this release cycle.  Additionally, the ability to access a
summary of all fields and methods on a class or record is deemed useful without
this feature.
