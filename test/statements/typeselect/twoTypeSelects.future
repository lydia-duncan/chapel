bug: multiple type selects (with overlapping cases?) break compilation

This test seems to show that if a single file contains multiple type
selects (or perhaps "multiple type selects with overlapping type
cases"), the compilation breaks due to the implementation approach
used for the type selects.  In particular, it seems that functions are
created for each case but without making the function names unique for
each type select statement.  This could probably be fixed simply by
keeping a counter of type select statements and using that to uniquify
the names of the functions for each statement.
